# Connectify: Social Media App

Introducing the first version of my new social media app, built using the MERN stack! This app is designed to bring people together and make it easy to connect and share with friends and family.

With Connectify, you can create an account, share posts and photos, comment on other people's content. You can also see events happening around your area, stay up-to-date on the latest news and participate in discussions.
